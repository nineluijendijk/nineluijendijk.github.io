# Guerilla Analytics framework {#guerillaframework}

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(here)
```


To keep my data manageable I use the Guerilla Analytics framework. This means I make sure every project has its own folder, every folder that needs it has a README and no raw data file is altered. The way I manage my data is visible in the tree below:

```{r generate directory tree, eval=FALSE}
dir_tree("/Users/nineluijendijk/Desktop/daur2")
```
```{r show the screenshot}
knitr::include_graphics(here("data/screenshot_dirtree.png"))
```
