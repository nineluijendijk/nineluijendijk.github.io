# Guerilla Analytics framework {#guerillaframework}

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(here)
```

To keep my data manageable I use the Guerilla Analytics framework [@ridgeGuerrillaAnalytics1st2014]. This means I make sure every project has its own folder, every folder that needs it has a README and no raw data file is altered. I also make sure to version control my code using [GitHub](https://github.com/)

The way I manage my data is visible in the tree below:

```{r generate directory tree, eval=FALSE}
dir_tree("/Users/nineluijendijk/Desktop/daur2")
```

```{r screenshot, fig.cap="Screenshot of my directory tree"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("data/screenshot_dirtree.png"))
```
